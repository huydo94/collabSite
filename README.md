# collabSite

collabSite is a video streaming site that serves YouTube videos synchronously to all users, where the videos come from a queue managed by the users. Everyone can submit videos to the queue, and admins can remove or change the order of videos in the queue. While watching the videos, users can chat with each other on a public channel.


The website is under development. To run the site on your local computer, first install Meteor: 

```
curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh
```

then clone this repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/huydo94/collabSite.git
```

```
cd collabSite
meteor npm install --save angular angular-meteor
```

Then hit 
```
meteor
``` 

to run the app. Go to your browser (preferably Chrome) and enter localhost:3000 to view the site.
